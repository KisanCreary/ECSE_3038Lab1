1.parallel()
Purpose: Calculates the total resistance of resistors connected in parallel. (it is for a lab) 
Input: List of resistances (in ohms).
Output: Prints the effective resistance in ohms, formatted to three decimal places.


2.potential_divider()
Purpose: Calculates the voltage drop across each resistor in a series circuit.(it is for a lab)

Input: Total voltage (in volts) and a list of resistances (in ohms).
Output: Prints the voltage drop across each resistor (formatted to two decimal places).
